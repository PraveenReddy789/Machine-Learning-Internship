# Machine Learning Internship at Cognifyz Technologies

Duration SEPT 2024 TO OCT 2024

# OVERVIEW
During my internship at Cognifyz Technologies, I focused on developing and implementing machine learning models to classify restaurants based on their cuisines and conduct location-based analyses. This involved handling large datasets, applying various algorithms, and gaining insights into user preferences.

# Key Tasks and Responsibilities
1. Cuisine Classification
Objective: Developed a machine learning model to classify restaurants based on their cuisines.
Steps:
- Preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Selected and trained models using Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting.
- Evaluated model performance with metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
- Achieved an accuracy of 85% and improved classification efficiency by 30%.


2. Data Preprocessing
Conducted thorough data preprocessing on a dataset of 20,000+ records.
Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables, resulting in a 20% reduction in data processing time.


3. Location-Based Analysis
Objective: Performed geographical analysis of restaurants in the dataset.
Steps:
Explored latitude and longitude coordinates, visualizing restaurant distribution on a map.
Grouped restaurants by city/locality to analyze concentration.
Calculated average ratings and price ranges, uncovering patterns related to restaurant locations.

4. Real-Time Recommendation Systems
Designed and implemented recommendation systems using collaborative filtering, leading to a 35% increase in user engagement and actionable insights for product development.

5. Model Evaluation
Conducted thorough evaluations using classification metrics, identifying biases across different cuisines and providing actionable insights for improvement.
Tools and Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Modeling Techniques: Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting
Other Tools: SQL for data querying

# Conclusion
This internship provided me with invaluable experience in machine learning, data preprocessing, and geographical analysis, enabling me to contribute effectively to meaningful projects and further develop my skills in data science and AI.
